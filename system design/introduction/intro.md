## System Design Mastery

### *What is System Design?*
System design has become a required skill for software developers and IT proffessionals. The term 'system design' refers to step by step process of defining the architecture, modules, data, component, and interface for a system to satisfy specified requirements. We can say that it's a preplanned archirtectural structure of the software.

### *Why we learn system design?*
There are some multiple obvious reasons why we learn how to design a system:

1. **Create blueprint for development**
So the pre-design of the system will work as a blueprint that developers/teams can follow before write the code. 
2. **To achieve efficiency and cost-effectiveness**
A thoughful and well-designed system is more efficient than other system and can lead to cost savings by effeciently managing the resources of the systems. ***Remember*** investing in scaling before it is needed is sometime not a smart business proposition, however, some forethought into the design can save valuable time and resources in the future.

### *How to: System Design?*
- **Understand the problem**: Have an understanding about the problem you are trying to solve by gather the information, identify users/client needs and the constraint or limitation of the system that we want to build
- **Identify the scope of the system**: Define the scope of the system, either what the system can do and cannot do.
- **Research and analyze existing systems**: We can learn from similar system that worked well in the past or in the current system, and use it to make a decision for designing a system.
- **Create high-level design**: We start with describing the component of the system and how the components will react each other. This inclue a rough diagram of the system architecture or a flowchart oulining the fow.
- **Refine the design**: As we work on the details of the system we refine it couple of times until we have complete and detailed design that meets all the requirements
- **Remember to document the design** : Create detailed documentation of the design for future reference so that its can be maintain
- **Continuously monitor and improve the system**
